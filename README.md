### ðŸŽ§ My First Web Dev Adventure â€” The K/DA Music Player

Every developer has that one project â€” the one that sparked the flame, kicked off the journey, and made them fall in love with code. For me, this is it.

This music player was the very first thing I ever built from scratch, and it holds a special place in my heart. Inspired by the virtual pop group K/DA from League of Legends, I wanted to create something cool and familiar using just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no fancy tools â€” just the raw basics and a whole lot of Googling.

At the time, it felt like I was climbing a mountain (spoiler: it was more like a hill, but hey, we all start somewhere). Managing media, styling layouts, figuring out how to make buttons do things â€” it was all new to me, and incredibly exciting. Even though the project is pretty simple looking back, it was a huge achievement for me then and a big reason why I chose to pursue web development seriously at a young age.

### ðŸŒ± Why This Project Still Matters

I keep this project front and center because itâ€™s the perfect way to show how far Iâ€™ve come. Everything Iâ€™ve learned since â€” from better coding practices to building more complex applications â€” stems from this humble beginning. And the best part? I did it all by teaching myself, without any professional training.

So while this might not be the flashiest thing in my portfolio, itâ€™s definitely one of the most meaningful. Itâ€™s my starting line, and a reminder of the passion that got me here.
