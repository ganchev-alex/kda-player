### ðŸŽ¶ Project Introduction

As mentioned before, this is my first project. I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple music player themed for the virtual group K/DA from one of my all-time favorite video games, League of Legends.

With the skills I had at the time, my intention was to demonstrate how to manage different types of media in HTML, present a basic understanding of working with CSS layouts, and briefly manipulate the DOM via JavaScript.

This project was created around 2019, and it ignited my passion for web development.
